EMBX Buffer Pool Example
========================

This example shows a producer/consumer system using a fixed buffer pool
being managed via EMBX ports.

Contents of the example
-----------------------

There are two fundamental components of the example.

 - producer.c sets up the buffer pool and then starts generating stuff 
              for the consumer.
 - consumer.c receives buffers from the producer and returns them at some
              later point in time.

Using the example
-----------------

This example requires GNU make (or strictly compatible) to build and
should be build as follows:

  make PLATFORM=<platform> OS_0=<os_for_cpu0> OS_1=<os_for_cpu1> example

For currently support platforms see the example runtime harness 
(../../harness).

The examples should be booted using the appropriate runtime loader,
see the Multicom user documentation for further information.
