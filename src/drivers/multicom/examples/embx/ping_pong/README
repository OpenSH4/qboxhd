EMBX Ping Pong Example
======================

This example shows the ping-pong of interrupts between two CPUs on the STm8000,
STx710X and STx7200.

This example is only supported where both the master and companion CPUs are 
running OS21.

The example shows how to achieve the following:

 - initialise the hardware mailbox library.
 - acknowledging and raising an interrupt.

Contents of the example
-----------------------

 - ping_pong_hello_master.c contains all the code to initialize and run the
                            master CPU.
 - ping_pong_hello_slave.c  contains all the code to initialize and run a slave
                            CPU.


Using the example
-----------------

The example requires GNU make (or strictly compatible) to build and
should be built at follows:

  make example PLATFORM=<platform> OS_0=os21 OS_1=os21

The examples should be booted using the appropriate runtime loader, see
the Multicom user documentation (Appendix A) for further information.
