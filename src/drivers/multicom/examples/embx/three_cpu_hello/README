EMBX Three CPU Example
======================

This example shows the creation of a shared memory transport containing three
CPUs on the STx7100/STx7109/STx7200 SoCs. 

The example shows how to achieve the following:

 - initialise the hardware mailbox library on the SoC.
 - determine which ST231 the code is running on at runtime.
 - configure the shared memory transport with 3 CPUs.
 - configure the shared memory transport with a fixed heap location.
 - initialising EMBX and opening a transport ready for communication.
 - simple message exchange.

Contents of the example
-----------------------

 - three_cpu_hello_master.c contains all the code to initialize and run the
                            master CPU.
 - three_cpu_hello_slave.c  contains all the code to initialize and run a slave
                            CPU.


Using the example
-----------------

The example requires GNU make (or strictly compatible) to build and
should be built at follows:

  make example PLATFORM=<platform> OS_0=os21 OS_1=os21

This will generate three binary executables:

 - obj/os21/st40/three_cpu_hello.out for ST40.
 - obj/os21/st231/three_cpu_hello_audio_core1.out for ST231 audio LX.
 - obj/os21/st231/three_cpu_hello_video_core1.out for ST231 video LX.
                
The examples should be booted using the appropriate runtime loader, see
the Multicom user documentation (Appendix A) for further information.

Points to note
--------------

The file, three_cpu_hello_slave.c contains code that will run on both the
ST231s. This code will determine at runtime which CPU it is running on and
configure itself appropriately. Note that although the ST231 images are
produced from the same C program they are linked at different parts of the
address space. For this reason it is important to ensure the correct
executable is loaded onto each processor.

The ST231s should not be booted until the ST40 has booted completely
and produced the following output.

  three_cpu_hello stated
  Initialized mailbox library
  Opening transport, waiting for ST200s to join in
