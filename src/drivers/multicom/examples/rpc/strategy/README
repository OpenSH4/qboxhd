RPC Strategy Example
====================

The strategy example is an entirely artifical example that demonstrates
the use of most of the copying strategies RPC supports.

Contents of the example
-----------------------

There are three fundamental components of the example.

 - strategy.h contains the RPC decorations describing the entire system
 - caller.c makes calls to the example functions
 - callee.c implements the example functions

Using the example
-----------------

This example requires GNU make (or strictly compatible) to build and
should be build as follows:

  make PLATFORM=<platform> OS_0=<os_for_cpu0> OS_1=<os_for_cpu1> example

For currently support platforms see the example runtime harness 
(../../harness).

The examples should be booted using the appropriate runtime loader,
see the Multicom documentation for further information.

Points to note
--------------

The callback example demonstrated RPC's sophisticated support for passing
function pointers. Note that the callback is restricted to functions listed 
in an import block (although it does not matter on which CPU the callback
is implemented).
