RPC Tricks Example
==================

The tricks example shows peculiar uses of RPC copying strategies
in order copy structures that would otherwise be impossible.

Contents of the example
-----------------------

There are three fundamental components of the example.

 - tricks.h collects the RPC decorations describing the entire system
 - caller.c makes calls to the example functions
 - callee.c implements the example functions
 - prefix.h example of copying length prefixed arrays
 - union.h example of copying unions as opaque binary objects

Using the example
-----------------

This example requires GNU make (or strictly compatible) to build and
should be build as follows:

  make PLATFORM=<platform> OS_0=<os_for_cpu0> OS_1=<os_for_cpu1> example

For currently support platforms see the example runtime harness 
(../../harness).

The examples should be booted using the appropriate runtime loader,
see the Multicom documentation for further information.

Points to note
--------------

Do not write RPC interfaces using these techniques if it possible to
change the API instead. These techniques are intended to make it easier
to port already designed and frozen APIs.

Each header file is heavily commented, read these comments carefully
before using these techniques in your own projects.
