MME multiple companion example
==============================

This example demonstrates the use of two companions to transform data
with a single transformer instance on each companion.

Each transformer instance is a simplistic 8-bit mixer that is used to
combine two signals. The example is based upon the MME getstart
example. It is strongly recommended that the reader is familiar
with the getstart example.

Contents of the example
-----------------------

 - host.c contains the client code that performs transform requests and
   displays the results as ASCII waveforms.
 - companion.c contains the minimal code required to boot the companion
   processor.
 - mixer.c and mixer.h together form a simple two channel 8-bit mixer.

Using the example
-----------------

This example is designed to run on STx7100 and STx7200 platforms where
the master is an ST40 and the companions are ST231s. Additionally this
example supports only the OS21 operating system on both the ST40 and ST231.

This example requires GNU make (or strictly compatible) to build and
should be build as follows:

  make PLATFORM=mb442 example

The examples should be booted using the appropriate runtime loader,
see the Multicom documentation for further information.

Points to note
--------------

The file, host.c, contains code that will run on both the ST220s. This 
code will determine at runtime which CPU it is running on and configure 
itself appropriately. Note that although the ST220 images are produced 
from the same C program they are linked at different parts of the 
address space. For this reason it is important to ensure the correct 
executable is loaded onto each processor.
