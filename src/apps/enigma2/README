With respect to the original source code, a lot of specific modifications were made
in order to run it in the QBoxHD that has a STb7101 sh4-based processor.
Do not expect that after compiling this code it will run flawlessly in 
another receiver, even if it has the same processor.
The reason for this is that some of the modified/added code is QBoxHD-driver 
specific.

The source code in this package is released under the GPL v2.
