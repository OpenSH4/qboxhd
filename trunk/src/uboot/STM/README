This directory contains some useful scripts for building and installing u-boot:

Build Scripts
=============

./STM/builduboot <arch>

  builds all the variants for an architecture (sh4 or st200).
  The built files will be placed in BUILT/u-boot/<board>-stm20

./STM/buildenv <arch>
  builds standard environments for installing onto u-boot targets
  The built files will be placed in BUILT/u-boot/<board>-stm20.
  Each board directory will contain a text version and a u-boot image file. 

./STM/mkenv <board> <outfile> 
  Writes a standard environment for board to outfile.

./STM/buildlinux <arch>
  Runs mkimage on all the kernel binaries found in the distribution for arch.
  The u-boot image files are placed in BUILT/kernel

./STM/mklinux -t <arch> -v <vmlinux> -n <image name> -t <tagefile>
  Wrapper script for creating a u-boot Linux image file. 


kscript
=======

This is a set of kermit functions for setting up u-boot on a board:

sendcmd <cmd>
  - send a single command <cmd> to u-boot via serial port
sendfile <file>
  - send a script file to u-boot via u-boot
sendub
  - copy u-boot.bin from current directory to target via serial port 
    and copy it to flash 
sendenv
  - send the env script file from installed u-boot target board directory and save to flash.
serialsetupub
  - send, via serial port, both u-boot and linux kernel from installed u-boot directory and save to flash.
  - If "setupenv" exists in local directory then will send that as well.

netsetupub
  - send, via network, both u-boot and linux kernel from installed u-boot directory and save to flash.
  - If "setupenv" exists in local directory then will send that as well.

Init scripts
============

There are 2 supporting shell scripts

setupub and netsetupub which call kermit to load u-boot using the kscript functions described above.


Standard environment
====================

This contains a number of scripts for managing u-boot and kernel images:

update
  copies the u-boot image from $load_addr to flash

setup-serial
  Loads u-boot and Linux kernel image into flash via serial port
setup-nfs 
  Loads u-boot and Linux kernel image into flash via network

getub
  Get u-boot image, via nfs, form u-boot directory on server into memory
getvm 
  Get kernel image, via nfs, from kernel directory on server into memory 
getrd
  Get ramdisk image, via nfs, from kernel directory on server into memory

sgetub 
  Get u-boot image, via serial, form u-boot directory on server into memory
sgetvm
  Get kernel image, via serial, from kernel directory on server into memory 

cpub 
  Copy u-boot image downloaded into memory using getub/sgetub into flash
cpvm 
  Copy kernel image downloaded into memory using getvm/sgetvm into flash
cprd
  Copy ramdisk image downloaded into memory using getvm/sgetvm into flash

boot_ram
  Boot Linux kernel from flash using ramdisk filesystem image
set boot_nfs
  Boot Linux kernel from flash using nfs mounted filesystem
set boot_hda  
  Boot Linux kernel from flash using disk mounted filesystem
set boot_disk 
  Boot Linux kernel from dedicated disk partition using disk mounted filesystem
set boot_ext2 
  Boot Linux kernel from ext2 disk partition using disk mounted filesystem
