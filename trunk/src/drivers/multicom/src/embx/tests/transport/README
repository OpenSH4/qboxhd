This is an experimental two-agent test suite for EMBX2. It is
dubbed the transport test suite because it is only intended to
test an single transport (whose factory config is compiled into
the harness).

Usage:

export TARGET=<master-hti>-<slave-hti>
gmake run

The TARGET variable will be used to include a makefile contained
in harness/targets/$TARGET.mak. This makefile will provide the
harness configuration required to launch tests on the stated HTIs.

Although the C is (nearly) capable of supporting many targets the
makefile harness has a few hardcoded dependancies that should be
eliminated. However for convenient auto-testing it may be best to
write the test harness in Perl, with a bit of care we should still
be able to use the EMBX2 build system to perform the build but this
should be mastered in Perl.

TODO

 - threaded object test
 - test EMBX_Address() and EMBX_Offset()
 - and bandwidth testing the the benchmark test
